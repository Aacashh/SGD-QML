# Stochastic Gradient Descent for Hybrid Quantum-Classical Optimization

This repository contains the Qiskit implementation of the paper "Stochastic gradient descent for hybrid quantum-classical optimization." It features the implementation of four different algorithms described in the paper, including a unique application of the fourth algorithm on the MNIST and Iris datasets.
